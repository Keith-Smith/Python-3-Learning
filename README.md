# Python-3-Learning


Good day everyone.
This is a simple readme. Currently this project will hopefully be used to learn some specifics to python3 by following books etc.
I am already fluent in python, but seems I come from a C++ background my code may not be considered very "Pythonic". So I wish to try and change that to where my code will read more fluently and hopefully become a more productive python developer.
